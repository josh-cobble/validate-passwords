# validate-passwords

Welcome to the password validator!

Enter any password into the terminal and the program will tell you if your password is valid. If your password meets the requirements,
you may enter more passwords to see if they are also valid. If your password is invalid, you will be prompted to enter a valid
password.

Note that you may enter 'exit' to exit the program and 'help' to view the password requirements. Note that you must enter these
exactly as stated without the quotation marks.

For the purposes of this program, valid passwords are between 8 to 16 characters (inclusive) containing at least 3 out of 4 of the following categories:

(1) lower case letters, i.e., a-z
(2) upper case letters, i.e., A-Z
(3) numbers, i.e., 0-9
(4) the following special symbols: ~!@#$%^&*()-=+_ */
